![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.2.2-orange)

This framework created to help you include [Kinescope](https://kinescope.io/) player into your mobile iOS application.

<!-- TODO add logo here -->

## About

This framework can help you include customizable video player into your mobile application, organize offline playing of your videos.

## Currently supported features

- online and offline playing
- fullscreen, minimal or picture in picture
- customizable UI of player

## Usage

First of all, init SDK somewhere at startup of your app

```swift
Kinescope.shared.setConfig(.init())
```

From now you can play any video or livestream from your dashboard.

Just init player instance with videoId

```swift
let player = KinescopePlayer(videoId: "some video id")
```

Add player view somewhere in your layout

```swift
let playerView = KinescopePlayerView()
view.addSubview(playerView)
```

Connect player and playerView together

```swift
player.attach(view: playerView)
```

Enjoy.

All controls already included into `KinescopePlayerView` and can be hidden optionally.
You can read full [documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md) or find more examples in our [Example-project](/Example).  

### Logger

For logging network request, player events or something else use `KinescopeDefaultLogger`.

First step is set `KinescopeLoggerLevel` into configuration at application startup:

```swift
Kinescope.shared.set(logger: KinescopeDefaultLogger(), levels: [KinescopeLoggerLevel.network, KinescopeLoggerLevel.player])
```

Use logger like this:

```swift
Kinescope.shared.logger.log(message: "Bad Request", level: KinescopeLoggerLevel.network)
```

or

```swift
Kinescope.shared.logger.log(error: NSError(), level: KinescopeLoggerLevel.network)
```

Also SDK has opportunity to use custom logger. Just use protocols `KinescopeLoggingLevel`, `KinescopeLogging`.
